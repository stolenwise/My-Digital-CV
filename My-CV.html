    <!-- Use the summary to explain some background that won't show up in Work Experience-->
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>As a hard-working Chicagoan from the South Side, I love to get the job done. I've
      been hired as my universityâ€™s spokesperson for commercials before I finished enrollment. 
      Then, founded the most-attended improv team on my campus. I started my career as a problem-solver 
      for a Marvel director. Afterwards, I started serving at an emerging V/A/XR animation company by 
      managing and enhancing their daily operations. I've learned I excel at taking challenges head-on. 
      Growing up creating and completing my own projects has developed my entrepreneurial mindset and 
      allowed me to motivate others.</p>
